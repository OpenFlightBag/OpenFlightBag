# OpenFlightBag

## Vision

OpenFlightBag intends to be the Electronic Flight Bag "EFB" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_bag>) solution for all kinds of users. No matter if it is used by a single Virtual/Sim Pilot or an Airline with one or multiple fleets and sub-fleets - even with a mixture of devices, like iPads / Windows Tablets / ...

OpenFlightBag is free, open-source and vendor-independent. Its goal is being a robust, powerful and complete EFB.

OpenFlightBag makes data from different sources, like Aircraft Interface Devices, Dispatch Systems or Navigation Databases commonly available to all EFB front-end applications.

OpenFlightBag breaks the EFB all-in-one packages, allowing operators to choose the perfect app for every use-case.
